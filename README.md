# Composer Azure Plugin

Composer Azure plugin is an attempt to use Composer with Azure DevOps artifacts, via universal packages.

## Install

Composer Azure Plugin requires [Composer 2](https://getcomposer.org/) and PHP8.1 or newer. It should be installed globally.

```
$ composer global require luis2307/composer-azure-plugin
```

You have to be logged in via
the [Azure command line interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-linux?pivots=apt#sign-in-to-azure-with-the-azure-cli)
.

## Usage

This plugin has two components. Publishing a composer package to azure and pulling the dependency.

### Publishing a package

In the package you want to publish you have to add an `azure-publish-registry` config to the `extra` block.

```json
{
    ...
    "extra": {
        "azure-publish-registry": {
            "organization": "dev.azure.com/<my-organization>",
            "project": "<my-project-name>",
            "feed": "<my-feed-name>"
        }
    }
}
```

This plugin adds a new composer command to easily publish the package. Just run `composer azure:publish` and it will
remove all ignore files (e.g. the vendor folder) and publish the code to azure artifacts.

### Use package as dependency

To use a published package add an `azure-repositories` config to the `extra` block. There you define which packages are
required for the current project. In the `required` block you then define the requirements as usual. The only downsite
is, that you can't use constraints and set a specific version.

```json
{
    "require": {
        "vendor-name/my-package": "1.0.0"
    },
    "extra": {
        "azure-repositories": [
            {
                "organization": "dev.azure.com/<my-organization>",
                "project": "<my-project-name>",
                "feed": "<my-feed-name>",
                "symlink": false,
                "packages": [
                    "vendor-name/my-package"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
